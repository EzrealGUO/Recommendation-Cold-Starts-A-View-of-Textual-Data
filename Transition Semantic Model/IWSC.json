Meet, network, brainstorm and team-build as we pedal together along the golden sands, seafront and beautiful coastal paths of Ryde on our unique and fun experience. The BoRo Beach Bike seats up to 17 people: ten pedallers who propel the bike, with two non-pedallers above the rear wheels, three seated at the back (for disabled, children or those that cannot cycle) and two seats next to the driver for children. We pedal as a whole, harnessing the group's energy to make the bike move. There is an electric motor to assist if necessary!, A driver at the front steers, signals and brakes on behalf of the group, as well as provides games and activities to get you talking, collaborating and team build. There is even a screen for videos and presentations. If it rains, plastic water-proofing awning extends from the roof to the base of each saddle, meaning each seat is enclosed from the elements Each padded seat is adjustable for height and there is storage facilities for small bags. Most of our rides lasts for 60 minutes and goes along the seafront with spectacular views of the sea, beach and coastlines. Each ride's halfway point is at a cafe where you can stop for a hot drink, food or to use the facilities. We also sell ethical water on the BoRo Beach Bike - still or sparking water in recycled, recyclable and resealable aluminium cans in an effort to reduce the plastics on the beach. Companies can hire the BoRo Beach Bike for an exclusive team meeting, and we can help organise food, drink or activities to make the most of your experience. If would like to hire the BoRo Beach Bike for your group, please get in touch at IoW@BoRoBeachBike.co.uk.",

Unlike traditional consultancy models, ours is a collaborative approach which builds on the best of our specialist skills and knowledge combined with yours. You use our people because of who they are, not just their products and services. INHERITED CAPITAL ALLOWANCES ....> Since the 2014 change in the law identifying inherited capital allowances within commercial properties is now legally defined as the responsibility of conveyancing solicitors at the point of sale, no longer the demise of accountants. More annoyingly, retrospective claims after completion of the sale are illegal. This new requirement to employ an independent outside agent such as ourselves is essential, otherwise the average 10-20% of original purchase value in tax allowances is lost forever. While accountants should continue to make claims for new capital investments they cannot claim for inherited capital allowances that do not have invoices because those are with the previous owners. The problem is that identifying and pricing the residual value of capital allowances within commercial properties is extremely complex, so much so that only we can drill down into the previous owner's allowances that were transferred to you. Inherited capital allowances are as they say originating from the previous owner!, These types of claims lead to many different circumstances which need individual consideration. An example of this is where a builder or developer who sells a stock item to you cannot claim but you can claim their outstanding allowances as inherited at the point of sale. This is on average 10-20 %of the builder's final sale value. HMRC RESEARCH & DEVLOPMENT CASH INJECTION.. > The myth that only patent claims are eligible for Research & Development tax credits is wrong. Every sector of business is now eligible. Many companies are not exploring their entitlement. Allow us to carry out a current state analysis that will identify and process the claim for you. This will cover your current tax year as well as any remaining unclaimed allowances in the previous two years of closed accounts. Even if you are loss making, you are still as eligible. R&D tax credits effectively inject new cash flow. About 4 hours is all it takes to talk it through on the telephone and collate the figures. There is also the narrative report writing time but the whole process can be completed in 4-6 weeks. Please do not assume because you would have had to 'do it anyway' to grow your business these tax credits do not apply. Exactly the opposite, R&D tax credits cover the new and creative 'stuff' - whatever that may be - that your company initiated to help make the money you are now earning as well as the administrative effort that underpinned the new sales. If you have not paid tax then the money is paid by cheque.",

Furniture donated by Island residents may otherwise have been taken to the landfill site so this also minimises the impact on the environment. Storeroom offers Island residents this recycling opportunity to really help their community and environment. Storeroom is actively seeking to forge links with other local businesses with a view toward reducing landfill by recycling useable items that otherwise might be discarded. Storeroom received The Queen's Award for Voluntary Services in 2017. This is the MBE for voluntary groups. In May 2018 Storeroom opened the Cowes Men's Shed.

Experience shows that we are approached when a situation requires specific input not readily available or, not unreasonably, not in-house. This ranges from regulatory requirements to specific approaches to habitat management, remediation or improvement and acute events, to chronic conditions with long or short term implications for habitats, species and water resources. In addition, increasingly, novel data collection methods and opportunities are investigated in order to work with aquatic systems and water resources to achieve optimisation. This has resulted in experience in global problem solving and input to commercial, government, conservation and research projects.",

        "description": "Maritime Toolbar and its Workflow Extensions are powerful and easy to use tools for manipulating maritime data directly in GIS. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer multiple benefits to maritime users wishing to store, analyse and disseminate environmental, asset and other data with a spatial component. Maritime Toolbar and its optional Workflow Extensions provide easy access to functions commonly required to help maintain assets, locate obstructions and assess and report on environmental conditions. Used in conjunction with an existing data storage system, or combined with Ocean Database, Maritime Toolbar is currently available as a plug-in to Esri ArcGIS and Cadcorp SIS, either or both of which can be provided as a bundled product. Installation, data migration and training are provided as options. Recent functionality additions include Coordinate Translators, Bathymetric and Port Electronic Navigational Chart (bENC/pENC) Creation and Differential Surface Calculations. The functionality of Maritime Toolbar can be extended, by linking to Ocean Database, to incorporate Hydrographic Survey, Dredging data, Environmental Sampling and Asset Management data. These Workflow Extensions allow both current and historical data to be effectively managed. They enable fast interrogation and reporting of the data and use the power of GIS to allow further analysis not available within a standard database. OceanWise offers solutions for environmental monitoring. Being independent from any manufacturer or provider means our customers get the best system for their needs and the best possible price. If you need to display real-time data over the web but don't have the IT setup to enable this then the Port-Log.net subscription service will suit your requirements. If you are just starting out with a project and need assistance deciding on appropriate instrumentation then our advisory services are available to help you. Port-Log.net, Quick and easy on-line storage and publishing solution for environmental data acquired by different monitoring techniques and sensors, Port-Log System, Real-time environmental data storage and publishing software provided off-the-shelf and installed on site, Ocean Database, Proven flexible data management solution for all common types of marine data, Design and Installation, Independent advisory, design and installation services for any stage of a project. A basic requirement for implementing desktop and web based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is the availability of digital base mapping. On land, suitable datasets are generally available from national mapping agencies. However, for marine and coastal areas this is not the case. As a result, OceanWise personnel have pioneered the processes necessary to re-purpose hydrographic office data designed purely for navigation. Over 10 years of work and experience has culminated in OceanWise producing the innovative and user-friendly Marine Themes and Raster Chart datasets. Marine Themes, A vector data product depicting marine geographic features and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the seabed, currently covering North West Europe. Raster Charts and Raster Charts XL, Background data based on the popular nautical chart series from the UK Hydrographic Office. Raster Charts XL has the land removed and is ideal to use in conjunction with land mapping e.g. from Ordnance Survey or with satellite imagery.

Is your indicator microbe testing in line with current US regulations? Do you want to run the risk of delays and/or Port State intervention that regular testing will overcome?Biofouling - 1. Understand your vessel's specific needs: Is your antifouling system matched to your vessel's operational profile (including port visits and lay-ups)? Have you matched your hull cleaning programme specifically to each vessel's operational profile? Do you have a fit-for-purpose biofouling risk assessment?, 2. Survey your vessels: Do you perform regular biological surveys to understand what you are carrying on your hull and in your, sea chests, stabilisers and thrusters? Have you got a scientifically robust biofouling management plan, essential to avoid route restrictions?Marine Environmental Survey - With unrivalled access to PML's world-class marine research we provide that little bit extra in what we deliver to our customers.

        "description": "MARINE WARRANTY SERVICES, TMC provides marine warranty and engineering services to the offshore oil, gas and renewable energy sectors. Insurers of offshore construction projects often stipulate that warranties are inserted in insurance contracts. The warranties oblige an assured to have a surveyor verify the proceedings in connection with a proposed marine operation. Such insurance warranties are formal undertakings provided by an assured, the breach of which may entitle the insurer to avoid liability under the policy from the time of the breach. The surveyor's role in these circumstances is to witness that all the necessary precautions are taken to avoid a loss or otherwise maintain the level of risk as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). Marine Warranty Services include:, SUITABILITY SURVEYS, A suitability survey provides underwriters and an assured with an independent assessment that a vessel or barge, its personnel, management, ship-board administration, configuration, machinery and equipment, fixed and loose gear are found suitable and that the vessel is in principle, fit for the proposed operation. The survey seeks to provide assurance that a vessel or barge is capable of safe operation. This means that direct as well as indirect risks inherent in the proposed maritime operation may be considered and maintained as low as reasonably practicable for the duration of the operation. Through the findings of the survey, the assured is made aware of any apparent deficiencies in the vessel that may affect the operation, or of any recommendations that may otherwise help improve the operational efficiency of the vessel and its ability to perform its work. DESIGN AND PROCEDURE REVIEWS, The MWS will usually be required to review and approve any engineering design specifications and procedures. Documentary reviews are required to be completed within an agreed timeframe. The documents, procedures and drawings to be reviewed will often include approval of the load-out, transportation and installation of platform structures, pipelines, cables or subsea installations. ATTENDANCES OFFSHORE, Attendance will routinely be required at: ports, yards and fabrication facilities for the load-out or transfer of structures to barges or HLV; offshore for the installation of platform jackets, topsides & structures on field; mooring or hook-up operations; the installation of pipelines, cables and umbilicals; the installation or removal of subsea structures. ON AND OFF-HIRE SURVEYS, An on or off-hire survey is undertaken to provide prima facie evidence of the condition of the vessel at given time. When any vessels are mobilised, the MWS may be required to survey vessels to ensure that any non-conformances arising from the earlier suitability survey have been implemented. When any vessels are mobilised or demobilised the MWS may be required to ascertain the condition of a vessel at the time of on or off-hire and report the quantity of any chargeable items or consumables remaining on board at a given time. OFFSHORE SERVICES, The TMC Offshore Team has experience in all disciplines necessary to support the offshore oil, gas and renewable energy industries. Our global office network is able to reach world-wide operations. We are ready to mobilize at short notice. The TMC Offshore Team has experience in the following: Offshore Marine Warranty Services Offshore structural installations Decommissioning and salvage of offshore installations Renewable energy / wind farm installations Load out and Load-in assurance Provision of Client Representatives to the offshore industry FSO/FPSO operations and installations FSO/FPSO conversion feasibility studies Anchor Handling assurance Deep sea and inshore towage assurance Semi-sub, jack-up and offshore barge operations Offshore mechanical engineering survey, investigation, supervision and support Dynamic Positioning approval assurance, trials, procedure review and incident investigation CMID and OVID Surveys",
